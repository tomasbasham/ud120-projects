    "In 2000, Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services company based in Houston, Texas. It was founded in 1985 as a merger between Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth, both relatively small regional companies. Before its bankruptcy on December 2, 2001, Enron employed approximately 20,000 staff and was a major electricity, natural gas, communications and pulp and paper company, with claimed revenues of nearly $101 billion during 2000. Fortune named Enron \"America's Most Innovative Company\" for six consecutive years.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of 2001, it was revealed that Enron's reported financial condition was sustained by institutionalised, systematic, and creatively planned accounting fraud, known since as the Enron scandal. Enron has since become a well-known example of willful corporate fraud and corruption. The scandal also brought into question the accounting practices and activities of many corporations in the United States and was a factor in the enactment of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002. The scandal also affected the greater business world by causing the dissolution of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, which had been Enron's main auditor for years."

A better strategy is to impute the missing values, i.e. to infer them from the known part of the data.\n",

    "Label leakage [1] occurs when a predictive model includes data that will not be available at prediction time. This is a subtle form of cheating caused by features that give a bias towards the target label. For example if trying to predict whether an Enron employee is a person of interest we were given a feature expressing whether they had been incarcerated, `is_incarcerated`, this could possibly be an extremely useful indicator as to whether the Enron employee was in fact a person of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example an employee will be incarcerated after they are given the status person of interest. So the raw dataset shows a strong correlation between the two features. But `is_incarcerated` will frequently be changed __after__ the value for `poi` is determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictive model will show that a value of `False` for `is_incarcerated` indicates that an employee is not a person of interest. Since the validation data comes from the same source as the testing data this pattern will continue and the model will perform very well. However the same model will perform poorly when used on new data not containing the `is_incarcerated` feature. It is generally recommended that to prevent this type of data leakage, any variables updated (or created) after the target label is realised should be excluded from the dataset."

    "A much different type of leak occurs when you aren't careful distinguishing training data from validation data [2]. For example, this happens if you run preprocessing (like fitting the Imputer for missing values) before calling [`sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html). Validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data it hasn't considered before. You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behaviour. The end result is that your model will get very good validation scores, giving you great confidence, but perform poorly when deployed to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of fitting, including the fitting of preprocessing steps. This is easier if you use [`sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html). When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you use pipelines and do your preprocessing inside the pipeline."

That is an SVM maximises the distance to the nearest point in both classes which consequently maximises the robutness of the classification decision boundary. This is a classic optimisation problem, putting correct classification above maximising the margin. So there may be cases where the margin is reduced in order to correctly classify all examples.\n",

This transforms a non-linearly seperable feature space into one that can be separated. Most importantly these functions can map the results back into a low dimentional feature space.\n",

    "Support vectors are the points that lie along the supporting hyerplane. One key factor that plays into the complexity of the runtime for a support vector is the penaly parameter, `C`. The penalty parameter allows for a soft-margin and better generalization. The number of support vectors varies depending on the penalty we allow and how the data is distributed. The lower the penalty the fewer support vectors we get, creating a smoother decision boundary. Converserly the higher the penalty the greater the number of support vectors, having the effect of prioritising the number of correctly classified examples.\n",

A low kernel coefficient has the effect of creating a straighter decision boundary due to training examples further from the hyperplane having a higher influence on the algorithm. On the otherhand a high kernel coefficient causes the decision boundary to become less linear because only those examples closest to the decision boundary have any influence on the algorithm."

Instead I have selected to use the `sklearn.svm.LinearSVC` classifier which is similar to `sklearn.svm.SVC` with a linear kernel, but instead is implemented in terms of `liblinear` rather than `libsvm`. Because of this it has more flexibility in the choice of penalties and loss functions and should scale better to large numbers of samples.\n",

That is a Random Forest classifier is composed of a number of smaller classifiers, in this case decision trees: a non-parametric supervised learning method used for both calssification and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees attempt to create a model that predits the value of a target variable (represented by the leaves) by learning simple rules informed by the features within a dataset. These rules create decision boundaries (represented by the branches) that attempt to separate disimilar examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree can be \"learned\" by splitting the input data into subsets based on an attribute value test. This process is repeated on each derived subset in a recursive manner called recursive partitioning. The recursion is completed when the subset at a node has all the same value of the target variable, or when splitting no longer adds value to the predictions. This process of top-down induction of decision trees is an example of a greedy algorithm, and it is by far the most common strategy for learning decision trees from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However One of the issues with decision tree learners is that they can create over-complex trees that do not generalise well from the training data. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.\n",

    "An important factor that governs the performace of a random forest is the number of decision tree the compose it. I believe it is generally accepted that the greater number of decision trees the more confidence we can gain from the consensus. However more decision trees, and therefore more subsamples of the training data, result in a classifier that is much slower to train.\n",

The first is [information gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain_in_decision_trees) and is intended for classification problems, similar to that of this experiment. The second function is gini impurity, intended for continuous values and therefore more appropriate for regression problems. It is interesting to note that both information gain and gini impurity are largely similar as metrics and generally the performance of a classifier will not differ using one or the other. There was a paper written comparing these two metrics where the most important remarks were:\n",

    "Intuitively I'd expect many of the persons of interest involved in the Enron scandal to have large contributions to their total payment from either a bonus or from some other means. In the scatter plot above you can see that many of the persons of interest receive a low salary in respect to their overall total payment but tend towards receiving a higher bonus. That is with expection to a small handful of Enron employees. Suspiciously there are a few data points that indicate a bonus much larger than the total payment they received. I thought this to be an error in the data, but having gone back to the FindLaw report it is clear that the total payment repoted for some employees was significantly reduced due to deferred income."

For example if one feature takes on a range of values much greater than the other features in the same dataset, the distance will be goverened by this particular feature.

You need not use every available feature when creating a model, therefore it is important to discover which features are contributing most to predicting the output variable. In our case this is the  likelihood an Enron employee is in fact a person of interest. This is a very difficult problem which often requires a deep understanding of the domain.

Furthermore irrelevant attributes may contribute to overfitting. Some Decision Tree algorithms, including the Random Forest classifier used in this experiment, attempt to make splits in feature values.

    "[Principal Component Analysis](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) (PCA) is a very useful unsupervised learning technique that can be used to tease out the latent features in a dataset. It achieves this by identifying and reframing the dataset by what are called its principle components (PC), the combination of attributes (directions in the feature space) that account for the most variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is mathematical fact that projecting data points onto the direction of maximum variance we minimise the distance from a higher dimensionality data point to its new transformed value. This translates to a minimal information loss after the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a gerneral process PCA is able to algorithmically create new features from a dataset and rank the relative powers of each new feature. So if we have `n` latent features that are driving most of the variation in the data (remember this minimises the informaton loss) PCA will pick those out and rank them as the `1st, 2nd, ..., nth` principle components where the 1st PC has the most effect, and the maximum number of PCs is equal to `min(num_features, num_examples)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically PCA finds a new coordinate space, through translation and rotation only, moving the centre of the coordinate system to the centre of the data. PCA works on eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, which is the equivalent of fitting those principle-component hyperplanes to the variance of the data. Why? Because eigenvectors trace the principal lines of force. In other words, PCA determines the lines of variance in the dataset which are so called its principal components with the first principal component having the maximum variance, second principal component (orthoganal to the first) having second maximum variance and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "When used for dimensionality reduction PCA will discard the principle components ranking the loweset and therefore having the least effect. This therefore reduces any noise in the dataset that is either adding little (or no) information or could be derived from other features."

    "[Linear Discriminant Analysis](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis.html) (LDA) is a supervised learning technique that in addition to identifying attributes contributing the most variance in the data (the scatter in LDA terms), as PCA does, computes the linear discriminants (LD) representing the directions in the feature space that maximise the separation between classes. This ensures good class separability in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general LDA algorithmically finds the boundaries around the clusters of classes, projecting the data points onto the direction of maximum distance between each class such that they are as separated as possible, with each cluster having a relative (close) distance to a centroid. Furthermore LDA identifies these cluster as satisfying two criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tMaximize the distance between the centroid of each class,\n",
    "1.\tMaximize the variation within each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When used for dimensionality reduction LDA will discard the linear discriminants that explain the least distance between classes thus reducing any potential noise generated by features that may posess some overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Discriminant Analysis is particularly suited to datasets that have more than two classes and is the preferred linear classification technique, say over logistic regression, that is limited to only two-class classification problems."

    "At this point I could also perform Principal Component Analysis to further reduce the number of features, but I think that the performance I am seeing does not necessitate the use of PCA, and the algorithms do not take very long to train even on a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one way that I try to combat the black box problem in machine learning. If I at least know what is going in to a model, then I can try to understand why the model returned a certain classification and it can inform my thinking to enable me to create smarter machine learning classifiers in the future."
