    Starter code to process the emails from Sara and Chris to extract
    the features and get the documents ready for classification.

    The list of all the emails from Sara are in the from_sara list
    likewise for emails from Chris (from_chris)

    The actual documents are in the Enron email dataset, which
    you downloaded/unpacked in Part 0 of the first mini-project. If you have
    not obtained the Enron email corpus, run startup.py in the tools folder.

    The data is stored in lists and packed away in pickle files at the end.

            # The idea of stemming is to improve IR performance generally by
            # bringing under one heading variant forms of a word which share a
            # common meaning. Stemming is not a concept applicable to all
            # languages. It is not, for example, applicable in Chinese. But to
            # languages of the Indo-European group, a common pattern of word
            # structure does emerge.
            #
            # Prefixes may be added on the left of words. So unhappiness has a
            # prefix un, a suffix ness, and the y of happy has become i with
            # the addition of the suffix. Usually, prefixes alter meaning
            # radically, so they are best left in place (German and Dutch ge is
            # an exception here). But suffixes can, in certain circumstances,
            # be removed. So for example happy and happiness have closely
            # related meanings, and we may wish to stem both forms to happy, or
            # happi. Infixes can occur, although rarely: ge in German and
            # Dutch, and zu in German.
            #
            # The Snowball stemmer accounts for prefixes and suffixes of words
            # and constitutes a common stem for them. So the stem for 'happy'
            # and 'happiness' is 'happi'. This idea is extended to include
            # proper nouns and places where common nouns wouldn't have suffixes
            # (e.g Germany).
